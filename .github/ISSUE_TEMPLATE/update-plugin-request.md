NOTICE: Most plugins do NOT need to be manually updated. If your plugin is set to auto_update in (https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/listing.json) you do not have to submit this form. If your plugin is fixed to a specific version and you would like to request it be auto-updated, please continue filling this out and either request a single update or enabling of auto-updates.

Please update my plugin:

Author: Me
Repo name:
Release:

- [ ] No, I do not want auto-updates enabled. Continue to pin releases.
- [ ] Yes, I would like auto-updates enabled.
